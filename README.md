JavaWeb这项技术业发展了十几年，从原来的红利期到现在的49年入国军，就业情景也不怎么好(成也spring败也spring)。随着node.js，vue等越来越多的产品和框架被开发出来，我们能更方便的开发，并且做到前后端分离。相信使用过的感受都会感受到单纯的WEB项目处理起来都很头疼，不是这里调试就是这里爆红。

再说下前端吧。“回看前端风雨飘摇的18年，很多人说前端已死，可是回顾历史，哪一次不是濒临死亡又挺过来了呢”。为什么提到这句话，我是一个爱好技术的人，也许互联网不像彼时的那么风光，但我还是希望能多学点技术，去做一些自己真正喜欢的东西

The technology of JavaWeb has been developing for more than a decade, from the original period of prosperity to the current situation where it is not so promising (both success and failure are attributed to Spring). With the emergence of products and frameworks such as node.js and vue, we can now develop more conveniently and achieve front-end and back-end separation. Those who have used it will feel that dealing with pure WEB projects is quite troublesome, either debugging here or encountering problems there.

Let's talk about front-end. "Looking back at the turbulent 18 years of front-end development, many people said that front-end was dead. However, looking back at history, every time it was on the verge of death but managed to survive." Why do I mention this? I am someone who loves technology. Perhaps the internet is not as glamorous as it used to be, but I still hope to learn more technology and do something that I truly love.
